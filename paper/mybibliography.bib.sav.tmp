  abstract = {The development of offshore wind energy has started to take place surprisingly quickly, especially in North European waters. This has taken the wind energy industry out of the territory of planning systems that usually govern the siting of wind farms on land, and into the world of departmental, sectoral regulation of marine activities. Although this has favoured the expansion of offshore wind energy in some respects, evidence suggests that the practice and principles of spatial planning can make an important contribution to the proper consideration of proposals for offshore wind arrays. This is especially so when a strategic planning process is put in place for marine areas, in which offshore wind is treated as part of the overall configuration of marine interests, so that adjustments can be made in the interests of wind energy. The current process of marine planning in the Netherlands is described as an illustration of this.},

The site selection criteria are classified into four categories: energy resources and economics, conservation areas and landscape protection, human activities, and the marine environment and marine ecology. We used marine spatial techniques from GIS and the investigated resources available in the country. The results indicate that offshore wind farms can be located along a wide range of the eastern and western coasts of Jeju Island, considering energy resources and economics only. However, when considering the four categories presented in this study, the number of feasible offshore wind farm sites was significantly less than when only energy resources and economics were considered. The data and analysis presented in this study will be useful for the offshore wind farm site selection around Jeju Island, and it will also contribute to minimizing the environmental impacts and reducing the social conflicts between stakeholders.},

Representation of the shaft systems of the wind turbines shall be taken into account when a simplified aggregate model of the wind farm is used in voltage stability investigations. Because the shaft system gives a soft coupling between the rotating wind turbine and the induction generator, the large-scale wind farm cannot always be reduced to one-machine equivalent and use of multi-machine equivalents will be necessary for reaching accuracy of the investigation results. This will be in cases with irregular wind distribution over the wind farm area. The torsion mode of the shaft systems of large wind turbines is commonly in the range of 1–2Hz and close to typical values of the electric power grid eigenfrequencies why there is a risk of oscillation between the wind turbines and the entire network. All these phenomena are different compared to previous experiences with modelling of conventional power plants with synchronous generators and stiff shaft systems.},

  abstract = {Utilizing renewable energy sources to reduce carbon emission and minimizing the fuel cost for energy saving in the OPF (optimal power flow) problem will contribute to reducing the global warming effect from the power generation sector. In this paper, we propose a DPOPF (distributed and parallel OPF) algorithm for the smart grid transmission system with renewable energy sources to account for the fast variation of the power generated by renewable energy sources. The proposed DPOPF algorithm is a combination of the recursive quadratic programming method and the Lagrange projected gradient method; it can achieve the complete decomposition and can be executed in the smart grid transmission system to make distributed and parallel computation possible. We also propose Petri nets to control the computational synchronization of the DPOPF algorithm under the asynchronous data arrival in the smart grid transmission system. The proposed DPOPF algorithm is applied to solve OPF problems in a smart grid transmission system with renewable energy sources on a 26-bus test system. The test results demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed DPOPF algorithm, which is fast enough to cope with the fast variation of the power generated by renewable energy sources, and justify the accuracy of the obtained solutions.},

  abstract = {The Canary Islands, as many islands and coastal regions, are characterized by no conventional energy sources (but renewable resources, mainly wind and solar), by a high population density and land scarcity. Taking into account this context, it is crucial to determine the offshore wind energy potential as a first step for the energy planning. For this purpose, a methodology adapted to islands' and coastal regions' requirements has been developed. The methodology is based on GIS (Geographical Information Systems), and takes into account technical, economic and spatial constrain. Wind turbines (bottom-fixed or floating according to the bathymetry) are placed within the resulting suitable areas, quantifying also the energy production and its cost. The economic analysis includes the calculation of the LCOE (Levelized Cost Of Energy), including integration costs, and the resulting resource cost curves. The methodology has been applied to a practical case, the Canary Islands. Results show that the electricity produced by offshore wind farms exceeds the yearly electricity demand. Moreover, the offshore wind energy cost is lower than the current electricity cost. The analysis provides further useful indicators such as percentage of suitable areas, surface covered by wind turbines, array density of turbines and marginal offshore wind energy cost.},
